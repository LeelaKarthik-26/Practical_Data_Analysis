# Lung Cancer Prediction Project

## 📊 Overview

This project focuses on **predictive analysis of lung cancer** using patient data and machine learning models. By analyzing key features such as age, smoking habits, and medical history, the notebook builds and evaluates classification models to predict the likelihood of lung cancer. This project was completed as part of a **Personal Data Analytics** coursework using Python.

## 🧠 Objective

- Understand patterns in lung cancer patient data  
- Preprocess and explore data for insights  
- Train and evaluate machine learning models  
- Predict lung cancer risk with high accuracy  

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- **Python**  
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**  
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**  
- **Scikit-learn**  
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## 🔍 Key Steps in the Notebook

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
3. **Label Encoding & Feature Selection**  
4. **Model Building**: Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM  
5. **Model Evaluation**: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix

## 📈 Results

- Logistic Regression: ~94% Accuracy  
- K-Nearest Neighbors: ~91% Accuracy  
- Support Vector Machine: ~96% Accuracy

The SVM model demonstrated the highest performance on the dataset.

## 📝 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how predictive modeling can support early detection of lung cancer using simple yet powerful classification algorithms. Future work could involve:
- Hyperparameter tuning  
- Cross-validation  
- Using more complex models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost)
